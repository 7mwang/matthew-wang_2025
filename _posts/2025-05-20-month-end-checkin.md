## So.. Where are we on this flowchart?

The - bug:
- Resolved
- Solved through testing how Slack sends bullet points, and using that in our regex

## New Features:

Multiline Descriptions:
- Before, you couldn't do more than one line of description, but now, multiple lines of description show up on the calendar separated by commas

Period Color Coding:
- Now that period 3 is also using the calendar feature, I decided that if a message would contain period 1/3, it would properly color code every associated event on the calendar
- If there is no period attached, it is assumed that the event is for every student, and turns gray.

The colors are similar to this
(please excuse my messy and unprofessional testing)

## What's in progess?

CRUD.

CRUD is still being worked on by my team and I. I am struggling to communicate with them about what they're doing, as I was under the impression that they were going to implement CRUD a lot earlier, but it seems that my communication was bad, as they weren't able to do this.

## What's left?

After CRUD is finished, the basic calendar functions will be completed, and we can move on to the next steps for the calendar, which may include rewriting frameworks in different languages, etc.
